echo - Living Democracy


License information:
--------------------

echo is an open source software and will later on be licensed under the "echo Public License" (ePL). This license
will probably be derived from the AGPL v3 in order to support echo's decentral, distributed approach and to prevent
islandisation and fragmentation of any publicly relevant data generated by the software.
The goal of ePL is to combine Open Source software with the philosophy of Open Data for all publicly relevant content
generated by the software in one single license.

Until the exact terms of echo Public License are published, copying, modifying, distributing, installing or using ANY
components or parts of this software without explicit written permission of the echo team is strictly forbidden.
If you would like to contribute to the development of echo, please contact us at team@echologic.org.

Please note, that the prohibitive terms of the current license are subject to change in the near future to pave
the way for an open source development strategy with active participation of engaged developers from our community.
